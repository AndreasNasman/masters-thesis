\chapter*{\makebox[\textwidth]{Acknowledgment}}
Firstly, I would like to thank Professor Johan Lilius for functioning as my supervisor during the writing process and for suggesting the topic in the first place. Secondly, I thank Adjunct Professor Marina Waldén for helping me with administrative tasks and supplying deadlines for the project. Also, for providing reference material and general help when the completion of this thesis seemed far away. I would also like to thank Åbo Akademi University for providing accommodation and maintaining an excellent environment for studying and writing. Without those, I could not have found the focus to finish this project. Lastly, I give a warm thank you and a hug to my girlfriend, Melissa, for always being there and giving me emotional support \ensuremath{\heartsuit}.
